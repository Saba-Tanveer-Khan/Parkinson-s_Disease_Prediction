# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

Deep learning-based project for predicting Parkinson's disease using pre-trained architectures (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50). Includes dataset, code, and results for evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset contains TRAINING, VALIDATION, and TESTING folders with labeled images for binary classification.

## Features
- Data augmentation using rotation, zoom, shear, etc.
- Transfer learning with VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50.
- Early stopping and learning rate reduction for optimization.
- Performance evaluation using metrics, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

## Results
- Accuracy and loss plots for each model.
- Confusion matrices and classification reports.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saba-Tanveer-Khan/Parkinson-s_Disease_Prediction.git
